# Book Pila!

Web app to manage ePub, mobi, PDFs, etc.

Developed using Django and Python3.

## Requirements

This web app requires ImageMagic and Ghostscript in order to manipulate PDF uploads.  By manipulate I mean to extract a cover photo.

## Plan

* Maybe be able to read ePub files online.
* Want to be able to track location read in ePub, mobi, and PDF files.
* Be able to sync files between devices.
* Have cover images for books.
